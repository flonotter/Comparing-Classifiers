Comparing Classifiers for Bank Telemarketing Success Prediction

Overview
This project focuses on predicting the success of bank telemarketing campaigns for selling bank products. We compared various classifiers, including K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Support Vector Machines (SVM), to identify the most effective model for this specific business problem.

Data
The analysis utilizes the bank-additional-full.csv dataset. This dataset includes several features related to customer information and telemarketing campaign details.

Methodology
The project follows these key steps:

Data Loading: Importing the dataset and initial exploration.
Data Exploration and Preprocessing: Including missing value checks, feature scaling, and encoding categorical variables.
Model Building and Evaluation: Implementing and evaluating the performance of different classifiers:
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
Logistic Regression
Decision Trees
Support Vector Machines (SVM)

Key Findings and Insights
The performance of each classifier was evaluated based on metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

Insights and Analysis:
General Performance: All models performed well.
Best Overall Performance: Logistic Regression and SVM showed the highest overall accuracy (91%). 

3. Next Steps and Recommendations:
Class Imbalance: Address the class imbalance issue, possibly through oversampling the minority class or using techniques like SMOTE.
Feature Engineering: Experiment with different feature engineering techniques to see if the model performance.
Model Tuning: Fine-tune hyperparameters of the models, especially for Decision Trees and SVM, to potentially improve their performance.
Ensemble Methods: Consider using ensemble methods like Random Forests or Gradient Boosting, as they might perform better in handling class imbalance and feature interactions.
Additional Metrics: Evaluate models using additional metrics like ROC-AUC score to get a better understanding of their performance.
Domain Insights: Collaborate with domain experts to gain deeper insights into features that are more predictive of successful telemarketing campaigns.
